            Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington, in July 1994. The company started as an online
            marketplace for books but expanded to sell electronics, software, video games, apparel, furniture, food,
            toys, and jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by
            market capitalization. In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for US$13.4 billion, substantially
            increasing Amazon's footprint as a physical retailer. In 2018, Bezos announced that its two-day delivery
            service, Amazon Prime, had surpassed 100 million subscribers worldwide.

            Amazon distributes downloads and streaming of video, music, and audiobooks through its Prime Video, Amazon
            Music, Twitch, and Audible subsidiaries. Amazon also has a publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, a film and
            television studio, Amazon Studios, and a cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services. It produces
            consumer electronics including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, and Echo devices. In addition,
            Amazon acquisitions include Ring, Twitch, Whole Foods Market, and IMDb. Among various controversies, the
            company has been criticized for technological surveillance overreach, a hyper-competitive and demanding work
            culture, tax avoidance, and anti-competitive practices.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in July 1994. He chose Seattle because of technical talent as Microsoft is located
            there. In May 1997, the organization went public. The company began selling music and videos in 1998, at
            which time it began operations internationally by acquiring online sellers of books in United Kingdom and
            Germany. The following year, the organization also sold video games, consumer electronics, home-improvement
            items, software, games, and toys in addition to other items.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2002, the corporation started Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provided data on Web site popularity,
            Internet traffic patterns and other statistics for marketers and developers. In 2006, the organization grew
            its AWS portfolio when Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which rents computer processing power as well as Simple
            Storage Service (S3), that rents data storage via the Internet, were made available. That same year, the
            company started Fulfillment by Amazon which managed the inventory of individuals and small companies selling
            their belongings through the company internet site. In 2012, Amazon bought Kiva Systems to automate its
            inventory-management business, purchasing Whole Foods Market supermarket chain five years later in 2017.
